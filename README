PyGet is a lightweight download manager the vein of wget and aria2.
But it'll be also provided with a Graphical frontend for better user experience.

I forked this project from the original project piddle (https://github.com/darthlukan/piddle) where I participated.

The decision is due to two reasons :
- Avoid collaboration matters due to my lack of git experience.
- my idea start to be more different than the original idea.

I want to make a download manager that is both easy to use and complete (with tons of new features)

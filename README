PyGet is a lightweight download manager in the vein of wget and aria2.

I forked this project from the original project piddle where I participate.
The decision is due to two reasons :

* Avoid collaboration matters due to my lack of git experience.
* my idea start to be more different than the original idea.

I want to make a download manager that is both easy to use and complete (with tons of new features)
